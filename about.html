                                    Stepping into the role of President, not only did I want to be the leader who oversees the events and logistics that happen ‘behind the scenes’; I wanted to act as a key support network for not only the executive members on the team but also those in the society as well- ensuring that the goals and voices of the co-op community were being heard and considered. 
                                    Outside of the society, my interests primarily include volunteering, cooking and creating banger spotify playlists.

                                    I decided to run for Vice President in order to channel my inner Nigel: the fun-loving guy who can bring a room together and give warm welcomes to everyone coming into Co-op Society. Seeing the first-years enjoy camp so much and create long-lasting memories and friendships honestly filled me with joy; it was definitely one of my biggest goals stepping into this position. It’s quite sad that we’ve been kept at home this term, but I’m looking forward to seeing you all in person again, and continuing to facilitate a friendly and fun environment
                                    Some of my hobbies include playing guitar, decorating my apartment, and going out with friends/family.

                                    I honestly believe that organisation is a staple to running any society. I applied to be secretary so that I could help be the backbone of the society. Along the way I’ve helped develop the teams’ communication abilities further, whilst simultaneously increasing my ability to work in and lead a team.  My goal is to have everyone working together as a tightly oiled machine, and so far it’s been pretty good!!

                                    Over the year as treasurer I have sought to consistently reduce costs associated with events whilst continuing to improve engagement and attendance. Coming from a shaky financial position previously, gaining a reasonable buffer fund for the society has been my main priority for the past term. My goal is to make a total accrual profit for the year of $1000.

                                    Coming into the Arc Delegate position, I knew I wanted to do more than becoming a communicator and a signature collector. I wanted to be able to give incoming co-ops the welcoming family experience I received from the society last year. 
                                    I stepped forward to help organise the buddy program to make sure that new scholars would make a strong connection right off the bat with people in the year above them.

                                    Social director and all-round LIFO. The aim for this year was to help y'all work hard, play hard. With COVID-19 in our systems, I’ve tried to help Co-op play hard, whether it be games over zoom, getting inebriated over zoom or finding love over zoom, I wanted to replicate that feeling of in person connection. Once COVID-19 is over, my goal is to throw a term you’ll never forget.

                                    As a Charity co-director I wanted to highlight the philanthropic side of Co-op Soc that our members tend to forget. Given that we’re a privileged bunch, it’s important we give back to the community, and these acts of kindness don’t have to be boring! We’ve already fundraised through the World’s Greatest Shave and started a new case comp initiative to help small charities. Later on we hope to run in the City2Surf and hold our much-anticipated Poker Night.

                                    Coming into the Charity Director role, my goal was to organise fun events that allow Co-ops to volunteer first-hand and give back to the community - to do good and feel good. We’ve had the opportunity to hold some great events, such as our upcoming online Case Comp partnering with a real charity to help them tackle a very real issue in our society. Looking forward to launching some of our planned events when in-person activities resume!

                                    Being a marketing director has allowed me to be more creative in the way the society presents itself. 

                                    I think that having a strong presence in how we promote ourselves can help us establish us as a better society and engage more Co-ops with events.

                                    I came into this role because I wanted to express my creativity and create a website that people would be willing and keen to use. I hope to make something that future Co-op Society members as well as alumni will continue to visit and find out more about how Co-ops are doing and what changes take place from year to year.

                                    As one of two First Year Representatives, I’ve had the opportunity to represent the Co-op Soc 2020 cohort, and function as a channel of communication between us and the Executive Body. My goals stepping into this role were to contribute effectively to the smooth running of the society and actively engage with my cohort, and throughout the year I’ve had the privilege to work on the 2020 Co-op Soc merchandise line, as well as learn from the current executive body.

                                    As one of this year’s First Year Representatives, my role has been to bridge the gap between the 2020 Co-op Soc First Year cohort and the Co-op Soc Executive team. My main goal for this year has been to play an active role in the society engaging with my cohort and working to design and distribute the 2020 Co-op Soc merchandise.
