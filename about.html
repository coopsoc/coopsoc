Overall, despite what 2021 throws at us, get keen for a good time!

Moreover, I hope to ensure a robust financial position into the future, building upon the work of previous treasurers so as to increase the society’s assets and lay the platform for continued development. I will also be working closely with Claire to organize the first-year buddy program, with my vision being the cultivation of stronger connections between cohorts.

In order to achieve this, we will be providing you all with events supporting a range of impactful charities as well as our own initiatives which not only allow co-ops a chance to give back, but also bring us all closer together as we do so.                                 </p>

                                    As one of this year’s First Year Representatives, my role has been to bridge the gap between the 2020 Co-op Soc First Year cohort and the Co-op Soc Executive team. I’ve strived to play an active role in the society by engaging with my cohort and working to design and distribute the 2020 Co-op Soc merchandise. After seeing how tightly-knit the second year cohort were, my main goal has been to foster a similar environment and make Co-op Soc a second family for my year.

                                    In my free time, my interests lie in playing cricket, watching movies and TV shows and dabbling in the saxophone.
