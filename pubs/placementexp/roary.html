        Industry Placement Experiences - Roary Xu

              <h2 class="card-title">What's the first industry placement like?</h2>
              <p class="card-text">
                I'm Roary, I’m currently spending my first placement in the SIAM (Service Integration and Management) department at AMP.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                One great thing about placement is that whilst your agreement may put you in a certain team or role, it is up to you to seek experiences in whatever you are interested in, and since this placement is my first, I was interested in everything. This advice was given to me by a few mentors, so I reached out and am now working on 3 separate projects in different teams across our department, providing me with a helpfully wholistic view of SIAM as originally I had no clue what it even stood for.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                My original assignment is with the Strategy team, in which we’re currently in the design stage of delivering a technical strategy. We’ve had countless workshops together as we gathered around whiteboards in meeting rooms, defining the scope of our strategy and the best ways to implement it with the resources we have available. Don’t fall for the stereotypes of seclusion in working in technology; it can be very enjoyably interpersonal and collaborative.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                However, I was also very interested in improving my technical skills during placement, and so I volunteered to take interim ownership of our department’s configuration database. With no previous experience, I’ve had to learn both on my own as well as by seeking help from experts on how to operate its several nuances; a challenge for sure, but I can appreciate the knowledge and experience it brings.
              </p>    
              <p class="card-text">
                Finally, my favourite initiative at AMP is leading an uplift of our team’s culture. Our new team basketball tournament was very successful and surprisingly competitive, however considering the current circumstances, we’re now enjoying online Skribbl.io sessions.

              <h2 class="card-title">What are some challenges you have encountered and how did you overcome them?</h2>
              <p class="card-text">
                Whilst first placement is a great opportunity to jump into a whole new world of new experiences, I made the mistake of saying yes to every piece of work offered to me and ended up overloading myself with commitments (at one point I was on 5 different projects). This meant I found myself working overtime/taking work home several days of the week, which I decided was unsustainable and not something I wanted to continue.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                I reached out to mentors at work who told me this was a great lesson in managing the expectations of your managers, or better yet not getting yourself into this situation in the first place by knowing how much work you can/are willing to handle.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                The first step was to decide which projects I was most engaged in, and the value that I could both add and receive from each of them. This led me to pushing aside an administrative role which I felt I wasn’t getting much value from, as well as a role in Service Economics which I didn’t feel engaged in.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                The second step was to work out how to push back on these commitments, by communicating my situation in the right way to their managers and figuring out any necessary compromises. Overall, I now feel much more engaged and comfortable with my workload; however, this could all have been avoided had I understood my capacity from the start and said no.
