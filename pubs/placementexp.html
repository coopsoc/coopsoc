                <p class="card-text">
                  I'm Roary, I’m currently spending my first placement in the SIAM (Service Integration and Management) department at AMP.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One great thing about placement is that whilst your agreement may put you in a certain team or role, it is up to you to seek experiences in whatever you are interested in, and since this placement is my first, I was interested in everything. This advice was given to me by a few mentors, so I reached out and am now working on 3 separate projects in different teams across our department, providing me with a helpfully wholistic view of SIAM as originally I had no clue what it even stood for.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My original assignment is with the Strategy team, in which we’re currently in the design stage of delivering a technical strategy. We’ve had countless workshops together as we gathered around whiteboards in meeting rooms, defining the scope of our strategy and the best ways to implement it with the resources we have available. Don’t fall for the stereotypes of seclusion in working in technology; it can be very enjoyably interpersonal and collaborative.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, I was also very interested in improving my technical skills during placement, and so I volunteered to take interim ownership of our department’s configuration database. With no previous experience, I’ve had to learn both on my own as well as by seeking help from experts on how to operate its several nuances; a challenge for sure, but I can appreciate the knowledge and experience it brings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, my favourite initiative at AMP is leading an uplift of our team’s culture. Our new team basketball tournament was very successful and surprisingly competitive, however considering the current circumstances, we’re now enjoying online Skribbl.io sessions.

                I’m Emily Kasovska and I’m currently undertaking my first industry placement at Coca Cola Amatil, working in Supply Chain Operations.              
              </p>
              <p>
                I am extremely grateful to be in an area of accounting that is closely linked to the management accounting course I am studying at university, thus allowing me to apply the theoretical concepts I’ve learnt into a real work setting. 
              </p>
              <p>
                My tasks are very diverse and are primarily completed on a monthly basis. This includes internal management reporting for scorecards/dashboards as well as cost variance analysis. I’ve also dabbled in working capital and capital project reporting as well as general accounting tasks such as posting journals and completing reconciliations. Many exciting ad hoc tasks and projects also arise within my role. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I was also fortunate enough to visit Amatil’s Eastern Creek warehousing site and the Northmead manufacturing plant. This was particularly useful for my role in Supply Chain; being able to connect my work from head office to the real operational sites was an exciting and enriching experience.

              <p class="card-text">
                I’m Lelland Hui and I’m currently undertaking my first industry placement at American Express, working in the Experiential Marketing Team.              
              </p>
              <p>
                I have found the experience of placement to be completely different to what I expected, but in all the right ways. For context, my team deals mostly with the events that American Express offers to their card holder's as a way of promoting American Express as a brand. This means that I have been able to go to great events all over Sydney from our member's lounge in Qudos, Elton John's Concert and Open Air Cinema. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The main project I was working on before COVID-19 shut us down halfway, was AMEX Delicious Month out. This project was one of the biggest events my team has ever planned and I was in charge of coordinating our volunteers for each event over the course of the month. This was no easy task because there were almost 30 volunteers each event and it was my job to make sure they all did their job properly. It was truly exhausting but an ultimately rewarding experience.

                Hi, I’m Stanley, 2nd year Data Science, currently working at PwC in Data Assurance.              
              </p>
              <p>
                During my first few weeks I was given a share trading project where we used Alteryx to highlight individuals that were conducting suspicious trades. I was then assigned to an internal training job where I built an Alteryx workflow to determine who in the Data Assurance team needed training in various technical areas.               </p>
              <p>
                The current project I am on is a data migration reconciliation project. At its core, we are checking whether the data migration from one company to another was done correctly.              </p>
